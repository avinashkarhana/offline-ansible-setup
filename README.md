# Ansible Setup

## Note

As of now this only supports RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.
Basically Yum based installation only

## Pre-requisite

    Python 3.9 or higher first. 
    - (If not present the script will try to install these by itself, if doesn't works, try installing yourself)

## Usage

1. Mark `setupAnsible.sh` as executable by running `chmod +x setupAnsible.sh`

2. Run `./setupAnsible.sh`
